><FONT size="+1"></B>I plan to pursue my long-term career goal of working in academic position as a professor at a top university. My research interest is Combinatorics including the combinatorial branches of Algebra and Financial Mathematics, such as Game Theory. NUS&rsquo;s Department of Mathematics is attractive because it possesses advanced research teams and leading professors in this particular field of study.<FONT size="+1"></B> </P

>Although Combinatorics is my specific academic focus, as a freshman, I found it closely tied to other areas of study in Mathematics. Mathematicians classified Kissing Number Problem into Combinatorics but nobody could deny its geometric significance. Moreover, among two references I read on this problem, Musin&rsquo;s <B><I>The Kissing Problem in Three Dimensions</I></B> applied orthogonal polynomial while Maehara&rsquo;s <B><I>The Problem of Thirteen Spheres&mdash;a Proof for Undergraduates</I></B> adopted numerical analysis on solid geometry. Same story happened before I was presenting a report in front of the Algebra class, talking about my research on adjacent matrix. While counting all feasible paths from one point to another on graph, I discovered the combinatorial implication of the multiplication of adjacent matrix. I realized that we applied Algebra to problems in Combinatorics, with which we illustrated the significance of Algebra conversely. Therefore, as stepping into sophomore, I was determined to build my skills in comprehensive branches of Mathematics in order to become an outstanding scholar in Combinatorics. </P

>I started my exploration in Algebra. I appreciate the mentor program held by Department of Mathematics for the research opportunity it provided. Guided by a great mathematician, also a pioneer in Algebraic Combinatorics, we were trying to solve open problems in Coding and Design Theory through study and discussion. During the well-structured twelve seminars, we read and gave reports on <B><I>The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes</I></B> and <B><I>Design Theory</I></B>. During our reports, our professor would challenge us and also propose some open problems about the topics we are discussing. My group&rsquo;s focus was finding the minimum size of weighted<FONT size="+1"> <FONT size="+1">balanced incomplete block designs, WBIBDs, using basic methods and we eventually proved that in the case of the total number of points being 8 and each block containing 3 points, a WBIBD contains at least 22 blocks. I currently am researching how I can apply our results to other cutting-edge questions in Design Theory. Hopefully, the findings will be original enough to serve as material for a future academic paper.  </P

>In the second semester of my sophomore year, I joined in a seminar designed to kick-start undergraduates&rsquo; ability to conduct independent research by working with both current graduate students and professors. We focused our discussions on Integral Systems with the goal of solving significant equations and expressing the solution in a research paper. Our readings included Hirota&rsquo;s <B><I>The Direct Method in Soliton Theory</I></B>, by which we studied the property of bilinear operator, how they are applied to the solution of KdV and how they could be extended to complex equations under multi-component conditions. With the methods learned in the seminar, I computed the solution to a multi-component Ito equation and verified it algebraically with Pfaffian polynomial, with which the solution can be stated in a simpler form. Eventually, I completed a publishing-level paper on the solutions I built by the end of the seminar. </P

>The third year was my harvest season. Thanks to Richard Stanley&rsquo;s <B><I>Enumerative Combinatorics</I></B>,<B><I> </I></B>I was given a graduate-level introduction to this fascinating area of Mathematics. My great passion earned myself a membership of the SJTU&rsquo;s research group of Enumerative Combinatorics, where I submitted my first paper as a co-author after six months study. I am looking forward to finding it on next year&rsquo;s <B><I>European Journal of Combinatorics</I></B>. Inspired by an existing recurrence formula, we studied the circle descent statistics on permutations. Having attempted hundreds of possibilities, I eventually constructed three involutions and moreover, I successfully extended these involutions from permutations to derangements, a subset of permutations, in which no element appears in its original position. Such extension gained its significance for a deeply structural regularity as well as beauty in form. Furthermore, motivated by the quantitative equality between permutations and perfect matchings, I constructed a concise bijection between the two sets. And surprisingly, this bijection was also extended onto derangements. After submitting the paper, I started my work on another problem surrounding Tutte Polynomial and was devoted to making more contributions to this area.  </P

>My junior year attained its perfect ending the moment I finished my acknowledgement in the final presentation at UCLA. Through attending this ten-week, cross-disciplinary research program together with ninety students who are strictly selected from the top universities in China, I was impressed by the essentials of becoming a cutting-edge researcher in general. It is a great experience to work with Prof. Wotao Yin. Apart from the weekly seminar joined by other doctoral students, I was given the opportunity to conduct my own research. My academic focus this summer is operator splitting, which plays a leading role in a variety of algorithms in computational theory as well as applications. Besides two textbooks recommended by Prof. Yin, I collected over twenty references to the theory and applications of operator splitting. I learned the strict form and property of operator splitting scheme by<B><I> Convex Analysis and Monotone Operator Theory in Hilbert Spaces</I></B>. From <B><I>Distributed Optimization and Statistical Learning via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers</I></B>, I also digested the optimization problems and algorithms to which an operating scheme could be applied. Eventually, our group built our own splitting algorithm. I supplemented the proof of the convergence theorem and conducted over one hundred numerical tests, from low dimension to high, to investigate the sensitivity of our variables in order for higher efficiency. I expressed my results both on my academic poster and in the final presentation, during which I turned our research into a vivid story and impressed the audience coming from different fields out of Mathematics. Currently, we are still following-up on our results and looking forward to submitting it to a top-class journal. </P

>I enjoyed being a research assistant but I must become as independent a researcher as my mentor, a team leader, a problem discoverer, and a persuasive speaker. Therefore, I want to pursue a Ph.D. in Mathematics at National University of Singapore in order for an advanced knowledge system in my area as well as a potential for conducting independent research in the future.  </P

>After I graduate from the Ph.D. program, I will first apply for post-doctoral positions at both universities and research institutes in order to build my research skills and portfolio. Once in an academic position, I will create my own research teams of both graduate and undergraduate students. I hope the results of our research will not only create theoretical breakthroughs in pure math, but also can be applied into more practical uses in computational science and engineering. </P
